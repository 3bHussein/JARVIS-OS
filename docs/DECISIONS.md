# Architecture Decisions

Append-only historical decisions. Date: 2026-10-27 (Africa/Cairo).

| ID | Status | Decision | Reason / consequence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ADR-001 | IMPLEMENTED | Independent monorepo and read-only discovery | Preserve existing application behavior and production data. |
| ADR-002 | IMPLEMENTED | Personal, health and corporate are distinct domains | Corporate connector is disabled and absent from GitHub allowlist; no health-to-cloud AI data flow. |
| ADR-003 | IMPLEMENTED | React/Vite static client first, Next.js deferred | Tauri uses a static frontend; current shell does not need SSR. |
| ADR-004 | IMPLEMENTED | Minimal loopback API before NestJS/Postgres | Deliver an executable slice without pretending persistence/multi-user auth exists. Production remains blocked. |
| ADR-005 | IMPLEMENTED | All writes disabled at policy and HTTP boundaries | Confirmation alone is insufficient to authorize an unimplemented action. |
| ADR-006 | IMPLEMENTED | Existing WHOOP OAuth remains the source | Build delegated read access later, not a second token inventory or privileged DB coupling. |
| ADR-007 | IMPLEMENTED | Timesheet getState is not safe read-only | It initializes sheets/data; prefer private Sheets read scope later. |
| ADR-008 | IMPLEMENTED | Lexora launch-only | Browser-local progress has no established server API. |
| ADR-009 | IMPLEMENTED | No default AI memory/audio retention | Privacy, deletion and consent must precede persistence. |
| ADR-010 | IMPLEMENTED | Voice diagnostic before quality claims | Microphone visualization and system TTS are test tools, not measured STT/TTS delivery. |
| ADR-011 | IMPLEMENTED | No deployment in initial CI | User requires explicit deployment authorization. CI checks only. |
| ADR-012 | IMPLEMENTED | Upgrade Vite 7.1.7 → 7.3.7 | npm audit identified advisories; patched version returns zero known vulnerabilities in this environment. |
| ADR-013 | BLOCKED | New private GitHub repository creation | No create-repository connector tool; no gh or shell credentials. Keep independent local Git project and deliver complete source archive. |

## Voice engine evaluation — design only

| Candidate | Fit | Risks / required evaluation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| faster-whisper multilingual + Silero VAD | Local CPU int8 or CUDA; push-to-talk first | Model size/RAM/CPU latency, silence hallucination, Egyptian dialect, code-switching. Distil English examples are not Arabic evidence. |
| whisper.cpp | Native/local candidate for a Windows sidecar | Packaging, model licensing, CPU latency and thread budget need real Windows tests. Not installed. |
| Streaming wrapper / whisper_streaming | Incremental stabilized transcripts | Added scheduling and endpointing complexity; partial revisions and speech interruption must be handled. No performance claim. |
| Cloud streaming STT | Optional low-local-resource path | Explicit audio consent, provider retention/region, service cost and dialect benchmark needed. No provider selected or contacted. |
| Piper | Offline neural speech candidate | Exact Arabic voice availability, naturalness, model quality and GPL/model licenses must be reviewed before distribution. |
| Neural cloud TTS | Optional natural/streaming speech | Compare Arabic/Egyptian voice listening scores, first-audio latency, usage cost, privacy and cancellation. No paid call made. |
| Browser system TTS | Current diagnostic fallback | Voices/Arabic support vary by OS; no guaranteed quality or audio activity synchronization. |

M5 evaluation corpus: at least 30 synthetic script utterances plus user-approved recordings spanning Egyptian Arabic, English, mixed speech, ProgressXX/WHOOP/Lexora names and automotive product names. Record engine/model/version/hardware, word error rate with explicitly documented normalization, named-entity accuracy, p50/p95 time-to-final/first-audio, interruption result and human intelligibility rating. Suggested targets are hypotheses, not current measurements; choose release thresholds after baseline and user review.
