# Test Report

Session: 2026-10-27, Africa/Cairo. Synthetic fixtures only. No destructive or production-account tests.

## Executed evidence

- Node.js 24.22.1 / TypeScript 5.9.3 / React 19.1.1 / Vite 7.3.7.
- `npm run check`: typecheck PASS, 14 unit/HTTP tests PASS, static production build PASS.
- `npm audit --json`: zero known vulnerabilities after Vite upgrade; not proof of absence of all security bugs.
- `npm run test:e2e`: final result is appended below after completion. Early attempts exposed accessible-name/label issues and were not passing acceptance runs.
- Build output at the initial passing build: JS 209.93 kB (67.00 kB gzip), CSS 15.59 kB (4.56 kB gzip). Bundle size is not an animation performance benchmark.
- CI workflow authored, not run remotely. No deployment or Windows installer test.

Raw sanitized command output: `docs/evidence/check.txt`, `audit.json`, `browser.txt` after final capture.

## Terminology

IMPLEMENTED means code exists. TESTED means the specific recorded test passed. VERIFIED requires a named evidence artifact/command and is always scoped. RELEASED requires release gates and actual distribution; no current feature is labelled RELEASED.

## Final acceptance — 2026-10-27T13:23:24+03:00

**15/15 unit/HTTP tests PASS; 10/10 Chromium synthetic browser checks PASS; TypeScript PASS; production build PASS.** GH-05 additionally proves that declared and streamed oversized responses fail closed. Full outputs are stored in evidence/check.txt and evidence/browser.txt. Final bundle: JS 210.20 kB / gzip 67.04 kB, CSS 15.59 kB / gzip 4.56 kB.

UI-01..10 are TESTED for the listed scopes. The desktop screenshot was inspected internally for layout; it is not a user deliverable and is excluded from the archive. No actual AI, real STT, voice quality, live integration, Windows or PWA release acceptance was performed.

Local source Git commit SHA is recorded in DEVELOPMENT-LOG after the source commit; no PR/CI/deployment URL exists.

## Successful remote foundation CI — 2026-10-27T14:25:50+03:00

Status: VERIFIED for the exact source/config commit `59e0bc4655cca1e4181532afe2a38931d8c977e3`. GitHub Actions run https://github.com/3bHussein/JARVIS-OS/actions/runs/40495860032 completed with conclusion `success`. npm ci, npm run check (typecheck, 15 unit/HTTP tests and build), Chromium installation and npm run test:e2e (10 synthetic browser acceptance checks) all passed. Evidence metadata: docs/evidence/github-foundation-ci.json. No live personal-account or Windows/voice-quality acceptance is implied.

Restored .env.example, .gitignore and .github/workflows/ci.yml. 40 pre-existing tracked file blob hashes matched the previously tested local source, with zero differing shared blobs. BUILD-INFO.json/history.bundle were preserved. Local checkout was aligned to origin/main after preserving earlier local log edits in a named Git stash; git diff origin/main was empty. git check-ignore confirmed .env, node_modules, apps/web/dist and test-results exclusions.

Repository: https://github.com/3bHussein/JARVIS-OS (public at inspection). Repository-access blocker K-001 and ADR-013 are resolved for this supplied repository. Private visibility has not been established. No PR, deployment, production DB change or other project write occurred.

The documentation-only follow-up records this result using a [skip ci] commit because it does not change runtime, tests, dependencies or CI configuration. It does not claim a separate CI execution for its own SHA. Next actions: continue connector freshness/configuration and production identity work with synthetic data; actual STT and Windows delivery remain pending.

## Workspace batch — 2026-10-27T20:20:21+03:00

21 unit/HTTP tests PASS, TypeScript PASS, build PASS (workspace-check.txt). New coverage:

| Requirement | Evidence | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Validated non-sensitive persistent preferences | PREF-01 | Corruption/invalid values/storage denial/private-field projection |
| Accurate configured/ready/stale metadata | CACHE-01, STATUS-01 | No fake success timestamp; time-driven stale status |
| Same-session cache/dedup/ETag | CACHE-01 | One upstream call for concurrent equal reads; TTL and 304 revalidation |
| Session isolation and failures | CACHE-02, CACHE-04 | No shared cache; historical timestamp on outage; cleared data after 401 |
| Provider cooldown | CACHE-03 | Retry-After respected across resources, including a two-hour window; no hidden retries |
| Authentication after async read | STATUS-01 | Revoked in-flight provider result returns 401 and cannot expose data |
| Device preferences and offline UI | UI-11, UI-12 | Chromium synthetic; final full browser report follows |
| Cross-context server session revocation | UI-13 | Added to browser acceptance; result follows |

No actual GitHub/user data, paid provider, STT or production database was tested. No dependency versions changed. Browser request fixtures explicitly substitute a synthetic GitHub token/transport; they do not inherit the ChatGPT GitHub connection.

### Final local workspace acceptance — 2026-10-27T20:20:48+03:00

21/21 unit/HTTP tests PASS, TypeScript/build PASS, and 13/13 Chromium browser checks PASS, including server-side revocation on focus. Evidence: workspace-check.txt, workspace-build.txt and workspace-browser.txt. No live-account/physical-device acceptance implied. Ready for exact-commit remote CI; no deployment.

### Provider error classification correction — 2026-10-27T20:24:16+03:00

Source workspace batch was published as `8a295e68306e92dd71f996efaefafbbac5a82434` (`feat: add session-aware sources and persistent preferences`). Run 40549833883 had passed npm ci/typecheck/unit/build and was still installing Chromium at inspection. A subsequent review found ambiguous HTTP 403 classification. Added normalized `forbidden` for permission-denied responses without rate-limit evidence; explicit 429 or 403 with rate-limit headers retains `rate_limited`. Both respect a conservative cooldown, preserving the true error through that interval. No automatic retry.

Added CACHE-05. Final local acceptance after correction: **22/22 unit/HTTP tests, TypeScript/build and 13/13 browser checks PASS**. Evidence: workspace-final-check.txt and workspace-final-browser.txt. This supersedes the earlier 21-test count for the corrected source. No dependency, provider credential, production DB or deployment change. A new exact-commit CI follows publication; do not treat the predecessor run as proof of the correction.

Publication tooling: one combined JSON source read exceeded the tool output budget; no remote mutation occurred from that failed parse. Retried with bounded independent file groups, created Git tree/commit and updated main using expected-head protection. Local work was preserved in Git stash then fast-forwarded to origin/main. No unapproved external repository was changed.

## Session 003 delivery handoff — 2026-10-27T20:26:02+03:00

Published implementation commit: `8a295e68306e92dd71f996efaefafbbac5a82434`. Published correction/current source commit: `a1bb666eb2f4c3564bdc37734c84a8c6fb51f431`. Changes are on main. No PR or deployment. Local checkout fast-forwarded to origin/main; local changes were preserved in named Git stashes before alignment.

Final local evidence: 22 unit/HTTP tests and 13 Chromium scenarios PASS, plus TypeScript/build. Exact corrected-source remote CI: https://github.com/3bHussein/JARVIS-OS/actions/runs/40550291400. At this recorded checkpoint status was IN PROGRESS: npm ci and npm run check succeeded; Chromium installation was in progress and remote browser tests pending. **Remote browser CI is not yet VERIFIED.** The predecessor run 40549833883 is not evidence for the correction. Snapshot: docs/evidence/workspace-github-ci.json.

Attempted to retrieve predecessor job logs while the job was running; GitHub returned BlobNotFound/404 for not-yet-available logs. This is not an application test failure. No production or real-account test was executed.

Immediate next action: inspect run 40550291400, record its actual outcome and fix a concrete failure if any. Do not claim successful remote acceptance from this pending snapshot. Then continue the planned optional local AI adapter/voice pipeline and production identity design. GitHub runtime needs its own server credential; ChatGPT connection is not reused. Existing health/task/corporate apps remain unchanged and disconnected. Documentation-only checkpoint commit uses [skip ci] to avoid another redundant source test run.

## Launcher batch — 2026-10-28T01:05:34+03:00

Local: 24 unit/HTTP tests PASS, typecheck/build PASS, one separate real-process launcher smoke test PASS. START-01 covers runtime/config validation and no secret error disclosure; START-02 covers occupied-port ownership; START-03 covers setup preservation, path spaces, API/UI readiness, authentication, second-instance failure without killing the first, and owned-process shutdown. Interactive Linux PTY first-run password creation was exercised separately with synthetic input. Evidence: startup-check.txt/startup-smoke.txt.

Previous workspace remote CI is now VERIFIED as success for a1bb666 / run 40550291400, including 13 browser scenarios. Current launcher Windows CI is pending; Linux PTY is not Windows certification. Physical double-click/default-browser/Ctrl+C and Tauri installer remain untested. No deployment or real account acceptance.

## Session 004 remote acceptance — 2026-10-28T01:07:49+03:00

Source commit: `48a94393880dfaabacabb8127081f4ec652c23d5` (`feat: add first-run setup and one-window Windows launcher`). Exact-source GitHub Actions https://github.com/3bHussein/JARVIS-OS/actions/runs/40592161891 completed SUCCESS. Both foundation (ubuntu-latest) and windows-launcher (windows-latest) jobs passed. On each platform: npm ci, typecheck, 24 unit/HTTP tests, build and one real-process launcher smoke passed. Windows BAT help entry points passed. Linux additionally passed all 13 browser scenarios. Evidence: docs/evidence/startup-github-ci.json.

Status: VERIFIED for this automated Linux/Windows scope only. Physical double-click/default-browser/console Ctrl+C are still manual acceptance items; Tauri installer, voice accuracy, AI and live data links remain incomplete. No deployment.

Local source was preserved in a named Git stash and fast-forwarded to origin/main. Final documentation-only commit records this successful source/run using [skip ci]; it has no new runtime change and does not claim a distinct CI execution.

User run path: install Node 24+, download and extract repository ZIP, run Setup-JARVIS.bat once, then Start-JARVIS.bat; open http://127.0.0.1:5173 and unlock in Settings with the setup password. Keep launcher open and Ctrl+C to stop. Full guide: docs/RUN-LOCALLY.md.

Exact next development: optional local AI adapter with explicit configuration, source attribution and synthetic tests; then push-to-talk STT/VAD and correction workflow. Do not mistake launcher availability for M6 completion. Corporate/health app data and production databases remain untouched.
